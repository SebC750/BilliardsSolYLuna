# Billiards Sol Y Luna Receipt Program
This program was made to track orders made by clients in the establishment, from drinks to snacks and time spent playing on the tables. Each table has its own timer and receipt log that appears when a new game starts. When players end their time, the total bill is printed out with the price of products, game time and sales tax all added to the total. 

UPDATE (10/28/2023):
After deliberation, It has been decided that this application is meant to run offline only. For these reasons, i will be changing my database from MySQL to NeDB. Flask/Python/MySQL has been removed in favor of an embedded database that can store and handle persistent data. 

Tech Stack:
HTML
CSS
Javascript
React.js
Bootstrap
NeDB


This is currently a work in progress.
