# Billiards Sol Y Luna Receipt Program
This program was made to track orders made by clients in the establishment, from drinks to snacks and time spent playing on the tables. Each table has its own timer and receipt log that appears when a new game starts. When players end their time, the total bill is printed out with the price of products, game time and sales tax all added to the total. 


This is currently a work in progress.
